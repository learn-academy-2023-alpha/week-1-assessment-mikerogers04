# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: GIT is the framework for which GitHub is able to function properly. Github is a browser based, central location where you can store code. You can store in repositories or branches off a main repository. You can push and pull code files to and from any Github repository that you have access to. You are also able to view code files and even edit them on the browser itself. 

Researched answer: GIT means Global Information Tracker and accessed mainly through the command line. GIT allows the sharing of code and the ability for others to contribute to that code. 

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: ===, >, >=, <, <=, &&, ||, ! - these are all conditional based operators that will return a true or false value

Researched answer: Forgot the "loose" equality operator (==), as it is not used often. All other operators in my answer were correct. 

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: An index can be defined in two cases. An index can be defined in strings. A string of characters is zero indexed. Also, an index is most commonly used in arrays. Arrays start at an index of 0. An index is the position of which a value can be. While a value can be a number, a string, characters, or referred to as an element in an array. 

Researched answer: An index is a particular location. Can use location and position interchangeably. Indexes go in sequential order. A value MUST be a JavsScript data type. 

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Arrays and strings are both zero indexed. Arrays have elements in each index position. While strings have a character at every index position. Arrays can have elements of different data types. Strings can only have characters. 

Researched answer: You can use string interpolation with strings and not arrays. 

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Pair programming use where two coders, usually a driver and a navigator, will code back and forth. The navigator will verbally tell the driver the syntax to type into the text editor. The driver will physically type the code into the text editor. 

Researched answer: Planning and tech setup is very important when pair programming. Be verbal back and forth so syntax and concepts are being understood. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: Built in methods in Javscript. Must take a function as an argument. 

2. Jest: A framework used to correctly check code syntax. 

3. Objects: A data type that use key value pairs. 

4. Method: A function thats being used by an Object data type. 

5. Classes: What defines an object and can be used again and again.
